 policy.1.t:0 "Press Censorship!"
 policy.1.d:0 "With the dust still settling on the recent government change, bodies of armed citizens, brandishing socialist flags and rifles, have entered the print houses of several of the nation’s largest newspapers and radio stations. Within hours, special editions were being run off printers across the country, and regular programming has been suspended. \n\nWhile a spokesman for the [Root.GetCommunistParty] has claimed that the freedom of press will be respected within reasonable limits, the presence of members of the commissariate in press offices tells a different story."
 policy.1.a:0 "Now, the press will serve the worker!"
 policy.2.t:0 "Press Censorship!"
 policy.2.d:0 "In response to the declaration of New Order, military police today seized the offices of the nation’s leading newspapers, nationalizing them under the strict new policies of the [Root.GetFascistParty]. Dozens of editors and writers were arrested, and a once-popular opinion columnist from a left-leaning paper was summarily executed outside the print shop for his crimes against the People’s Will. \n\nThere is now no doubt that the Party has full control over all legitimate print and broadcast media in the country. Though some small and independent publishers have fallen through the cracks, it is only a matter of time before they are suppressed."
 policy.2.a:0 "In the end, the sword is mightier."
 policy.3.t:0 "Return to Peace"
 policy.3.d:0 "The last shot rings through the air, then silence. \n\nPeace, at last. \n\nGovernment press releases have indicated that the last of the fighting is finally over, save a few pockets of individual resistance. In a speech this morning, [Root.GetLeader] declared that hostilities had officially ceased, and the nation would begin to revert to peacetime affairs. \n\nAmong the first of these changes would presumably be the dissolution of the censorship agencies and information control bureaus, restoring a free press."
 policy.3.a:0 "For too long we have put a damper on free speech."
 policy.4.t:0 "Press Opens!"
 policy.4.d:0 "With the population waiting with baited breath over the recent political upheavals, citizens of [Root.Capital.GetName] were surprised today by a rush edition of the state paper. Though only a single printed sheet, the headline had a resounding impact. The end of the fascist government means this last edition would the end for state journalism. \n\nNo longer does the writer or artist need fear the watchful eye of the censor, examining their work for any sign of opposition to the [Root.GetFascistParty]. Once again, the musician can experiment, the painter explore, and the scientist publish results that contradict the party line. It is the dawn of a new age of intellectual freedom in [Root.GetName]."
 policy.4.a:0 "Turn to Page 2 for Sports News"
 policy.5.t:0 "Press Opens!"
 policy.5.d:0 "After weeks of increasingly shrill “calls to action” for the citizenry, the state-controlled press has finally fallen silent, with no more orders to print from [Root.GetCommunistParty], or from Moscow. The streets are littered with the final editions, blowing unread in the wind. A fitting legacy for the fallen socialist party. \n\nIn it’s place, dozens of new papers large and small have begun cropping up, and new, tentative voices have filled the airwaves. Private citizens are taking back the media, and talking to anyone who’ll listen. Now, when you go to the corner shop, you see not one paper, but a dozen from across the entire political spectrum."
 policy.5.a:0 "Which one has the best crossword?"
 policy.6.t:0 "Rosie the Riveter"
 policy.6.d:0 "All the day long, whether rain or shine, \n\nShe's a part of the assembly line. \n\nShe's making history, working for victory, \n\nRosie, brrrrrrrrrrr, the riveter!"
 policy.6.a:0 "We Can Do It!"
 policy.7.t:0 "Total War!"
 policy.7.d:0 "The Enemy maintain that the German people is resisting the government’s total war measures. It does not want total war, but capitulation! \n\n I ask you: Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even yet imagine? \n\n\nOur propaganda minister packed the stands of the Berlin Sportpalast with a bold declaration; the German government will settle for nothing less than total war. Broadcast by radio and reprinted endlessly, the speech is a harbinger of the dread future that awaits Germany’s enemies."
 policy.7.a:0 "Now, people rise up and let the storm break loose!"
