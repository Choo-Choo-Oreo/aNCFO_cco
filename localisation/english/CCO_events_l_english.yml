 news_fall.1.d:0 "Earlier today at 19:40 the capture of the Harmonious Imperium’s capital was confirmed by officials in the Republica-Mercator, They say after days of fighting the entirety of Greater Harmonious City has fallen into their control. Propaganda from Harmonious Newspaper has noted that the Harmonious 18th Infantry Core with the 7th Heavy Armoured Brigade voraciously and bravely defended the city till the end! But due to that, they left the city in complete ruins with millions of war victims becoming homeless. Due to the large number of victims of war, a lot of partisans and thieves damage our military logistics network, therefore have bogged down our advances past the city itself. As well the Mercator Military Police are under constant attack by radical Harmonious partisans groups preventing them from restoring order. A citizen of the once-great city said “It was a wonder to behold until the war started and the aerial bombing campaigns from the Republica-Mercator and later our own country scorch earth tactics.”"

 news_fall.2.d:0 "Earlier today at 11:00 the Juntas Military pronounced the complete takeover of Harmony City. Our front-line news reporters have reported that the First Juntas Tank Core easily broke through the Harmonious defenses and stormed the grand city. Descriptions and Images have shown us that the city is just a pile of rubble since the Juntas Airforce and Tank Core completely ruined the city for possible generations to come, destroying countless artifacts, libraries, and guild stations. The Harmonious Newspaper has noted that the government has stated that the Juntas forces raped countless women when the city fell into their hands. The Juntas Government responded that they blamed them for their own misconduct. As of right now we can not confirm nor deny it, but we are aware that stuff like this is happening throughout major population centers."
