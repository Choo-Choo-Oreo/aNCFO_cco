We the people can't, and won't take this anymore. \n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] socialist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship against equality and human rights, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to leftists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a bloodless transition once we gain enough support."

Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue.

The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost.

 rcmpolitical.38.d:0 "The notion that the socialist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the socialist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for a complete social reform are no longer a desparate collection of activists and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled civilians and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The socialists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal socialists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular socialist method of removal: Revolution."

With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 rcmpolitical.40.a:0 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 rcmpolitical.40.b:0 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for socialism being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."
 rcmgeneric.13.a:0 "The people have the right to feel safe."

 rcmgeneric.14.t:0 "Welcome to Eight Years' War of Resistance!"
 rcmgeneric.14.d:0 "Thank you for playing the mod! However, The mod provides some rather complex mechanics and it can be a bit challenging. It is recommended for casual players to play on Civilian/Recruit difficulty for the first couple times to get used to the mod. Do not attempt Elite Difficulty or buff the enemies on first try, as it can be a hindrance for you to learn the mod.\n\nAside from that, following these tips can help you enjoy the mod more:\n    1. Go over starting national spirits: Go over the starting national spirits and help you understand what to do to either avoid certain bad things from happening or do things that can get rid of the debuffs.\n    2. Check decisions often: Sometimes there are things you are supposed to be doing described in decisions. Check the decision tab often can ensure that you don't miss out on some important things to do.\n    3. Read tooltips: Tooltips in this mod, especially the ones with special color highlights, usually provide you with useful information."
 rcmgeneric.14.a:0 "Thanks! I understand now."

 rcmgeneric.15.t:0 "Chinese Soviet Republic - Things to Note"
 rcmgeneric.15.d:0 "Playing as the Chinese Soviet Republic can be a challenge for most players. And due to the fact that its long-term victory will be mostly dependent on the Nationalists, there are several things to keep in mind for an enjoyable experience:\n    1. Do NOT buff Japan: The game has been carefully balanced so that Nationalist AI can fend off Japan on its own until the US entry into the war. Buffing Japan will disrupt the balance greatly and is very likely to create a game that's impossible to win.\n    2. "Contact Zhang Xueliang" ASAP: The "Contact Zhang Xueliang" National focus allows you to create a tacit truce with the Northeastern Army (represented as a DMZ in the game), which can ensure that the Nationalists won't attack you directly."
 rcmgeneric.15.a:0 "Thanks! I understand now."

 rcmgeneric.16.t:0 "How do I Get Rid of Some of the debuffs?"
 rcmgeneric.16.d:0 "The current country you are playing as include some National Spirit debuffs that can not be removed in the current focus tree or if you choose to go a certain branch in the focus tree. But worry not, those debuff can all be removed once you have unlocked the new focus tree that is available to your country."
 rcmgeneric.16.a:0 "Thanks! I understand now."

 rcmgeneric.17.t:0 "Settings: Unit Limit for AI"
 rcmgeneric.17.d:0 "As a way to reduce lag for late games, AI can be limited to produce less units, but we cannot assure the mod will be balanced with AI limit on."
 rcmgeneric.17.a:0 "No extra limit. (Recommended)"
 rcmgeneric.17.b:0 "limit the AI. (Use at your own risk)"
 rcmgeneric.17.c:0 "Only limit irrelevant countries. (Recommended)"

 rcmgeneric.18.t:0 "Settings: Plane Limit for AI"
 rcmgeneric.18.d:0 "As a way to reduce lag for late games, AI can be limited to product less planes, but we cannot assure the mod will be balanced with AI limit on."
 rcmgeneric.18.a:0 "No limit."
 rcmgeneric.18.b:0 "Turn on the limit."
