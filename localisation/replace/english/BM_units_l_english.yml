 # UNITS WITH DESCRIPTION

 bm_mot_command_regiment_desc:0 "Their mobility aids battlefield navigation and retreat, with transports carrying communications gear for command. However, they struggle in rough terrain and are vulnerable to anti-vehicle weapons."
 bm_light_tank_command_regiment:0 "Light Tank Command Company"
 bm_light_tank_command_regiment_desc:0 "Retrofitting command personnel with modified tanks ensures their protection while coordinating armored brigades. A command tank's presence also boosts morale among less motivated units."
 bm_medium_tank_command_regiment:0 "Medium Tank Command Company"
 bm_medium_tank_command_regiment_desc:0 "Retrofitting command personnel with modified tanks ensures their protection while coordinating armored brigades. A command tank's presence also boosts morale among less motivated units."

 bm_mortar_company:0 "Mortar Company"
 bm_mortar_company_desc:0 "Despite being conceived in the Great War, modern mortars have seen little design change despite more mobile warfare. They are more economical than artillery, though less powerful, making them suitable for reserve and frontline divisions."

 bm_pack_howitzer:0 "Pack Howitzer"
 bm_pack_howitzer_desc:0 "Mountaineers, Marines, and paratroopers required a lighter, more compact fire support piece for rough terrain that could fire both directly and indirectly. Mortars, being cheaper and more compact than Pack Howitzers, quickly became the preferred choice for military logistics officers."

 bm_workshop_company:0 "Workshop Company"
 bm_workshop_company_desc:0 "Despite advancements since the Great War, our armor still faces breakdown issues in combat. Companies with dedicated repair stations and training ensure that even complex tracked vehicles remain combat-effective."

 bm_river_crossing_specialists_desc:0 "Rivers are harder to defend than bridges, but typical wheeled vehicles struggle to cross them without help. Specialists skilled in building improvised bridges can assist both wheeled and tracked vehicles in crossing rivers."

 bm_urban_specialists:0 "Sapper Company"
 bm_urban_specialists_desc:0 "The cramped, maze-like layout of cities makes assaulting and occupying them costly. CQB specialists trained in demolitions can support offensives and prevent delays in the later stages of the war."

 bm_chemical_artillery:0 "Chemical Artillery"
 bm_chemical_artillery_desc:0 "Despite being banned by the Geneva Convention, many nations still stockpiled WWI and interwar chemical agents. Their illegal status hasn't diminished their appeal for disorienting and incapacitating entrenched enemy positions."
